<h1>U.S. and U.K. launch new wave of strikes</h1>
<p>The United States conducted a strike against a Houthi anti-ship cruise missile officials said was ready to launch against ships in the Red Sea, U.S. Central Command said in a statement.

    The strike Sunday morning local time was described as being carried in self-defense.
    
    Central Command said the missile was in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and "presented an imminent threat to U.S. Navy ships and merchant vessels in the region.
    
    It was not a continuation of the coalition strikes Saturday that hit 36 Houthi targets in Yemen.
    
    Friday's retaliatory strikes in Iraq and Syria are not seen as a deal breaker amid hostage-release negotiations between Israel and Hamas militants, a U.S. official said today.
    
    The negotiations and the strikes, retaliation for last week's drone attack by Iran-backed militants that killed three American soldiers in Jordan, are â€œproceeding independently of each other," the official said.
    
    The United States has pushed for remaining hostages to be released by Hamas, and for another, longer-lasting cease-fire in Gaza.
    
    Ismail Haniyeh, head of the political bureau of Hamas, said it wants a permanent end to the war and "a serious and rewarding" prisoner-hostage exchange as part of any cease-fire. Israel rejects limits to its warfare.
    
    A U.S. official said today that follow-up strikes on some of Friday's targets in Iraq and Syria are possible.
    
    The official said a damage assessment was underway and if it finds some targets were not fully destroyed a second round of strikes on those locations could be ordered.
    
    On Friday, U.S. forces struck 85 sites in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for a drone attack that killed three American soldiers and wounded 40 other people at a remote U.S. base in Jordan last weekend, U.S. officials said.</p>
